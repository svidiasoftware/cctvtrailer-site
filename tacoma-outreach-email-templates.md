## Best Practices for Email Outreach:

### Timing
- **Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM**: Best open rates for business emails
- **Avoid Monday mornings** and **Friday afternoons**
- Follow up **3 times** before considering lead cold (Days 1, 7, 14)

### Personalization
- Always use contact name (not "Dear Sir/Madam")
- Reference their specific location or business type
- Mention local crime statistics relevant to their area
- Reference competitors if appropriate ("3 other dealerships on South Tacoma Way...")

### Subject Lines
- Keep under 50 characters
- Include business name for personalization
- Use numbers/statistics when possible
- Create urgency without being pushy
- A/B test different approaches

### Call to Action
- Always include phone number and website
- Offer specific next steps (10-minute call, site assessment, custom quote)
- Make it easy to respond (phone, email, web form)
- Provide value even if they don't buy (free assessment, crime stats)

### Follow-Up Sequence
1. **Day 1:** Initial outreach (industry-specific template)
2. **Day 7:** Follow-up with different angle (ROI, recent local crime)
3. **Day 14:** Final follow-up (checking if timing is right)
4. **Day 30:** Move to quarterly "staying in touch" email list

### Tracking & Optimization
- Track open rates by subject line
- Monitor response rates by industry
- Note which benefits resonate (ROI vs. safety vs. liability)
- Adjust messaging based on responses
- Keep notes on objections to refine future outreach

## Objection Handling Scripts

### "Too expensive"
**Response:** "I understand the investment seems significant. But consider this: one major theft costs $45,000+ (for dealers) or $2.5M+ (liability lawsuit for retailers). Our service pays for itself after preventing just one incident. Can we look at the numbers together?"

### "We have cameras already"
**Response:** "That's great you're thinking about security. Most fixed cameras have blind spots and can't be relocated. Our mobile trailers offer 360° PTZ coverage and can be moved as needed. Can I show you the difference in a quick demo?"

### "We'll think about it"
**Response:** "Absolutely, this is an important decision. While you're considering it, would you like me to send over our ROI calculator and some recent case studies from [similar businesses] in Tacoma? That way you have all the information to make the best decision."

### "We haven't had any problems"
**Response:** "That's fortunate! The challenge is that most businesses don't invest in security until AFTER the first incident. By then, they've already lost $15,000-$50,000+. Proactive security is always more cost-effective than reactive. Can we at least do a free assessment to identify any vulnerabilities?"

### "We use security guards"
**Response:** "Guards are great for customer interaction. Many of our clients combine guards with surveillance for comprehensive coverage. Our trailers cost 60-75% less than guards, never take breaks, and provide video evidence. Would you be open to a cost comparison?"
