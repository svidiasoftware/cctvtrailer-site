          Washington State does not rely on federal OSHA alone. The Division of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) under L&I enforces its own workplace safety standards -- and in many cases, they are stricter than the federal rules. If you operate a construction site in the Tacoma-Seattle corridor or anywhere in Washington, here is the compliance checklist you need.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Washington's Own OSHA: Understanding DOSH</h2>

            <p>
              Most contractors know about federal OSHA, but many underestimate the significance of Washington's own enforcement arm. The <strong>Division of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH)</strong> operates under the <strong>Department of Labor & Industries (L&I)</strong> and functions as Washington's state-level OSHA program.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
              Washington is one of approximately 22 states (plus several territories) that maintain an <strong>OSHA-approved state plan</strong>. This means DOSH has its own set of rules, its own inspection teams, and its own penalty structure. Federal OSHA does not directly enforce workplace safety in Washington -- DOSH does.
            </p>
            <br>

            <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 my-8">
              <p class="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">Key Distinction</p>
              <p class="text-blue-800">
                Under federal law, state plans must be "at least as effective" as federal OSHA standards. In practice, Washington's DOSH standards are often <strong>stricter</strong>. The most notable example: Washington's fall protection trigger height for construction is <strong>4 feet</strong>, compared to federal OSHA's 6-foot standard. If you are following federal OSHA minimums on a Washington construction site, you may already be out of compliance.
              </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">DOSH Inspection Readiness Checklist</h2>

            <p>
              DOSH compliance officers can arrive at your construction site without warning. Being prepared for an inspection is not optional -- it is the baseline expectation. Here is what inspectors evaluate and the documentation you need to have ready.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What DOSH Inspectors Look For</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li><strong>Fall protection systems:</strong> Guardrails, safety nets, personal fall arrest systems at 4+ feet</li>
              <li><strong>Scaffolding compliance:</strong> Proper planking, guardrails, access points per WAC 296-874</li>
              <li><strong>Excavation safety:</strong> Shoring, sloping, or trench boxes for excavations 4+ feet deep</li>
              <li><strong>Crane operations:</strong> Operator certification, pre-shift inspections, load charts</li>
              <li><strong>Electrical safety:</strong> GFCI protection, lockout/tagout procedures, proper grounding</li>
              <li><strong>PPE usage:</strong> Hard hats, high-visibility vests, eye protection, hearing protection</li>
              <li><strong>Hazard communication:</strong> SDS sheets accessible, containers labeled, workers trained</li>
              <li><strong>Site access control:</strong> Perimeter security, unauthorized entry prevention, signage</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Required Documentation</h3>
            <p>
              DOSH inspectors will ask to see these documents. Having them organized and immediately accessible can make the difference between a clean inspection and a citation:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li><strong>Written Accident Prevention Program (APP):</strong> Required for all WA employers under WAC 296-800-140</li>
              <li><strong>Safety meeting records:</strong> Weekly tailgate/toolbox meeting logs with attendance</li>
              <li><strong>Training documentation:</strong> Fall protection, scaffolding, crane operations, hazcom</li>
              <li><strong>Equipment inspection logs:</strong> Cranes, scaffolds, excavation supports, rigging</li>
              <li><strong>Incident investigation reports:</strong> For any workplace injuries or near-misses</li>
              <li><strong>First aid logs and OSHA 300 records:</strong> Injury and illness tracking</li>
              <li><strong>Site security plan:</strong> Access control, monitoring, emergency procedures</li>
              <li><strong>Crane operator certifications:</strong> Washington requires certification per WAC 296-155-53100</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Common Triggers for DOSH Inspections</h3>
            <p>
              Understanding what triggers inspections helps you prioritize compliance efforts:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li><strong>Worker complaints:</strong> Filed anonymously through L&I -- the most common trigger</li>
              <li><strong>Severe injuries or fatalities:</strong> Automatic investigation within 24 hours</li>
              <li><strong>Referrals:</strong> From other agencies, hospital emergency rooms, or media reports</li>
              <li><strong>Follow-up inspections:</strong> Checking that previously cited violations have been corrected</li>
              <li><strong>Programmed inspections:</strong> Targeted sweeps of high-hazard industries (construction is always on the list)</li>
              <li><strong>Drive-by observations:</strong> Compliance officers who spot visible hazards from public areas</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-6 my-8">
              <p class="font-semibold text-yellow-900 mb-2">Pro Tip: Drive-By Visibility</p>
              <p class="text-yellow-800">
                DOSH compliance officers regularly drive through areas with active construction. If they can see workers without fall protection, missing hard hats, or unsecured scaffolding from the road, they have grounds to initiate an inspection. A mobile surveillance trailer with visible cameras serves as a signal that your site takes compliance seriously -- and gives you video proof of PPE usage to counter any allegations.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">How Mobile Surveillance Documents OSHA/DOSH Compliance</h2>

            <p>
              Meeting DOSH requirements is not a one-time event -- it requires continuous, documented compliance. This is where mobile surveillance provides a unique advantage that goes beyond traditional security. Time-stamped, high-definition video footage creates an objective compliance record that no amount of paperwork can match.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">PPE Usage Documentation</h3>
            <p>
              DOSH citations for PPE violations are common and difficult to contest without evidence. A 360-degree surveillance system operating 24/7 captures footage of workers across the entire site, creating a continuous record of hard hat usage, high-visibility vest compliance, eye protection, and hearing protection in designated zones. If a DOSH inspector alleges PPE non-compliance, time-stamped video provides objective proof of your crew's actual practices.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Fall Protection Compliance Verification</h3>
            <p>
              With fall protection as DOSH's number-one cited violation, documenting compliance is critical. Elevated surveillance cameras capture footage of workers at height, showing guardrail integrity, personal fall arrest system usage, and proper scaffold access. This footage serves as evidence that your 4-foot fall protection threshold (the Washington standard) is being met consistently -- not just during safety walkthroughs.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Hazard Communication Monitoring</h3>
            <p>
              DOSH requires that SDS sheets be accessible, containers be labeled, and workers receive training. Surveillance footage can document that hazardous material storage areas maintain proper signage, that restricted zones remain properly barricaded, and that unauthorized personnel do not access hazmat areas. For sites with ongoing chemical deliveries, camera footage provides a log of who accessed what and when.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Emergency Response Documentation</h3>
            <p>
              When incidents occur, DOSH investigates the employer's response. Video footage documents exact response times, evacuation procedures followed, first aid administered, and whether emergency protocols were executed properly. This evidence is invaluable during post-incident investigations and can demonstrate good-faith compliance even when an accident occurs.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Site Access Control and Security</h3>
            <p>
              Unauthorized access to construction sites creates both safety and liability risks. Mobile surveillance records all site access, including after-hours entry attempts, contractor arrivals, and delivery traffic. This access log satisfies DOSH requirements for controlled site access and provides evidence for <a href="/insurance-security-requirements" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">insurance compliance requirements</a> as well. For comprehensive construction site security information, see our <a href="/construction-security" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">construction security solutions</a> page.

              <p class="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">Compliance Benefit</p>
              <p class="text-green-800">
                DOSH considers "good faith" when calculating penalties. Employers who demonstrate proactive compliance efforts -- including investment in monitoring and documentation systems -- may receive penalty reductions of up to 25%. A mobile surveillance system operating as a continuous compliance documentation tool is strong evidence of good faith.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Washington-Specific Construction Safety Requirements</h2>

            <p>
              Beyond the general DOSH framework, Washington has several construction-specific standards that are stricter or more detailed than their federal counterparts. Contractors working in the Tacoma-Seattle area need to understand these differences.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">WAC 296-155: Safety Standards for Construction Work</h3>
            <p>
              This is the primary chapter governing all construction safety in Washington State. It covers everything from site preparation to demolition. Key sections include:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li><strong>WAC 296-155-24510 (Fall Protection):</strong> 4-foot trigger height, compared to federal OSHA's 6 feet. This single difference accounts for hundreds of additional citations in Washington each year.</li>
              <li><strong>WAC 296-155-657 (Excavation):</strong> Detailed requirements for protective systems, daily inspections, and atmospheric testing.</li>
              <li><strong>WAC 296-155-305 (Personal Protective Equipment):</strong> Specific requirements for head, eye, face, and high-visibility protection on construction sites.</li>
              <li><strong>WAC 296-155-53100 (Crane Safety):</strong> Washington has some of the nation's strictest crane operator certification requirements, including mandatory certification through an accredited program.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Washington Fall Protection: The 4-Foot Standard</h3>
            <p>
              The 4-foot fall protection trigger height is the most commonly misunderstood difference between federal and Washington standards. Contractors who operate across state lines or who rely on federal OSHA training materials often default to the 6-foot standard -- and get cited for it. In Washington, if a worker is exposed to a fall hazard of 4 feet or more, fall protection must be in place. Period.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              This applies to leading edges, holes, formwork, rebar assembly, precast concrete, residential construction, and roofing. The only exceptions are limited situations where conventional fall protection is infeasible and a written fall protection work plan has been developed and approved.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Washington Crane Safety Requirements</h3>
            <p>
              Washington's crane safety program under WAC 296-155-53100 is among the most rigorous in the country. Requirements include:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>All crane operators must hold certification from an accredited certifying entity</li>
              <li>Annual crane inspections by a Washington-accredited inspector</li>
              <li>Pre-shift inspections documented daily</li>
              <li>Assembly/disassembly must be directed by a qualified person</li>
              <li>Proximity to power lines requires specific clearance distances and procedures</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Outdoor Heat Exposure Rules</h3>
            <p>
              Washington was one of the first states to adopt permanent outdoor heat exposure rules, now codified under WAC 296-307-097. While the Pacific Northwest climate makes extreme heat less frequent than in southern states, summer months in the Tacoma-Seattle area regularly see temperatures that trigger these requirements:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li><strong>At 80 degrees F:</strong> Employers must provide drinking water, shade, and encourage preventive rest breaks</li>
              <li><strong>At 90 degrees F and above:</strong> Mandatory 10-minute cool-down rest periods every 2 hours</li>
              <li><strong>At 100 degrees F and above:</strong> Additional observation and buddy-system requirements</li>
              <li><strong>Year-round obligation:</strong> Employers must have a written outdoor heat exposure prevention plan</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Mobile surveillance can document that shade structures are in place, that water stations are accessible and stocked, and that mandatory rest breaks are being observed -- all of which become relevant if a heat-related illness leads to a DOSH investigation.
            </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                  DOSH (Division of Occupational Safety and Health) operates under Washington's Department of Labor & Industries (L&I). Washington is one of approximately 22 states with an OSHA-approved state plan, meaning DOSH enforces its own standards that must be at least as effective as federal OSHA but can be stricter. For example, Washington's fall protection trigger height for construction is 4 feet, compared to federal OSHA's 6 feet.

                <p class="mb-6">
                  DOSH penalties include up to $7,000 per serious violation and up to $70,000 per willful or repeat violation. Failure-to-abate penalties can reach $7,000 per day. Penalty amounts are adjusted based on employer size, good faith efforts, and violation history. DOSH can also issue immediate restraint orders to shut down work that poses imminent danger.

                <p class="mb-6">
                  WAC 296-155 is Washington's Safety Standards for Construction Work. It covers fall protection (stricter than federal at a 4-foot trigger height), scaffolding, excavation, crane safety (including the nation's strictest crane operator certification under WAC 296-155-53100), electrical safety, hazard communication, personal protective equipment, and site security requirements. All Washington construction employers must comply with these standards.

                <p class="mb-6">
                  Yes. Time-stamped video footage from mobile surveillance systems can document ongoing compliance with safety standards including PPE usage, fall protection deployment, hazard communication signage, and emergency response procedures.
