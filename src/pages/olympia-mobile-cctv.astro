          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Olympia is not a typical mid-sized city. As Washington's state capital, it faces security pressures that far exceed what a city of roughly 55,000 residents would normally encounter. The <strong>Washington State Legislative Building</strong> and surrounding Capitol Campus draw tens of thousands of visitors, lobbyists, staffers, and demonstrators each year -- creating a security environment more comparable to cities three or four times Olympia's size.
          </p>

              <p class="text-gray-700">
                When the Washington State Legislature is in session (January through April in odd years, January through March in even years), downtown Olympia's daytime population swells by an estimated <strong>10,000-15,000 people</strong>. Staffers, legislators, lobbyists, and visitors flood Capitol Way and the surrounding blocks. This population influx increases foot traffic, parking lot congestion, and property crime opportunities -- particularly vehicle break-ins and theft from businesses near the Capitol.

              <p class="text-gray-700">
                The Capitol Campus is a focal point for political demonstrations of all kinds. From large-scale organized marches to spontaneous gatherings, protest activity can escalate rapidly and spill into surrounding commercial areas. Businesses along Capitol Way, 4th Avenue, and the downtown corridor frequently request temporary surveillance during high-tension legislative periods, especially around contentious votes and budget sessions.

                Olympia has struggled with homeless encampments near Capitol Campus, along the waterfront, in Sylvester Park, and throughout the downtown core. These encampments have been associated with increased property crime, vandalism, and safety concerns for nearby businesses and government employees. The <strong>Capitol Lake / Estuary area</strong> and <strong>Marathon Park</strong> have been particular hotspots, prompting property managers and construction crews to invest in mobile surveillance.

                The Evergreen State College campus on the west side of Olympia brings its own security dynamics. With over 2,500 students and frequent community events, the surrounding residential and commercial areas -- particularly along Cooper Point Road and the Westside corridor -- experience elevated property crime compared to Thurston County averages. Construction projects and development sites near campus are frequently targeted for material theft and vandalism.

                The Washington State Capitol Campus spans over 50 acres and includes the Legislative Building, the Governor's Mansion, the Temple of Justice, the Insurance Building, and numerous auxiliary structures. Security for this complex is managed by the Washington State Patrol, but <strong>adjacent properties, parking areas, and perimeter zones</strong> often fall outside their purview.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Private property owners, construction contractors working on state projects, and event organizers operating near the Capitol Campus need independent security solutions. Our mobile CCTV trailers fill this gap -- providing <strong>government-grade surveillance</strong> that can be deployed to parking lots, staging areas, construction zones, and temporary event spaces around the Capitol perimeter.

                <p>
                  <strong>Situation:</strong> A commercial property owner on Capitol Way requested temporary security for the 105-day legislative session. Their parking lot and building entrance were experiencing increased vandalism, unauthorized overnight parking, and employee safety concerns during evening hours.

                <p>
                  <strong>Solution:</strong> We deployed a solar-powered CCTV trailer with 4K PTZ cameras covering the full parking lot, building entrance, and sidewalk approach. License plate recognition logged every vehicle. Motion-activated alerts notified the property manager of after-hours activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Outcome:</strong> Over the session period, the trailer deterred multiple unauthorized access attempts, documented two vandalism incidents that led to identification of suspects, and provided the property manager with complete activity logs. Vandalism dropped to zero after the first two weeks of deployment.

              <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Property crime is overwhelmingly the dominant concern in Olympia and Thurston County. Theft, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism constitute the vast majority of reported crimes. For property owners, businesses, and construction sites, this means the threat is not primarily about violent confrontation -- it is about <strong>unattended assets being targeted during off-hours</strong>.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                This is precisely the type of crime that mobile CCTV surveillance is designed to prevent. Visible camera presence deters opportunistic thieves, while 4K recording and license plate recognition provide evidence that leads to arrests and convictions. Our clients in the Olympia area consistently report <strong>dramatic reductions in property crime</strong> within the first two weeks of trailer deployment.

              <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Fixed surveillance systems work well for properties with stable security needs. But Olympia's security landscape is <strong>dynamic and seasonal</strong>. Crime patterns shift with legislative sessions, summer festivals, construction cycles, and encampment locations. A <a href="/mobile-vs-fixed-surveillance" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900 font-semibold">mobile CCTV trailer</a> can be redeployed as threats evolve -- moved from a construction site to a parking lot to an event venue as needs change throughout the year.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                For <a href="/construction-security" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900 font-semibold">construction projects in Olympia</a>, this flexibility is critical. Job sites progress through phases where different areas need protection. Our trailers move with your project at no additional cost, and because they are completely <a href="/solar-powered-surveillance" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900 font-semibold">solar-powered</a>, they work on sites long before electrical service is available.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              We deploy from our Tacoma headquarters at 222 E 26th St, just 30 miles north on I-5. Standard deployment to Olympia is within 24-48 hours. Emergency deployment for Capitol Campus incidents, protest situations, or urgent security needs can be arranged same-day with a 45-60 minute response time. Call <a href="tel:2536832288" class="text-emerald-700 font-semibold">(253) 683-2288</a> for immediate assistance.

            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Do your mobile CCTV trailers meet government facility security requirements?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Yes. Our trailers meet or exceed security requirements for state government property. We provide 4K surveillance with license plate recognition, encrypted data storage, secure chain-of-custody for footage, and background-checked service personnel. We are experienced with government procurement processes and can provide all required documentation including W-9s, insurance certificates, and bonding.

            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-3">What makes Olympia's security situation different from other Washington cities?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Olympia faces unique challenges as the state capital. Legislative sessions bring 10,000+ additional people downtown. Protest and demonstration activity at the Capitol is frequent and sometimes unpredictable. The city has a 1-in-23 chance of being a crime victim, with 44 crimes per 1,000 residents -- higher than 92% of Washington cities. Homeless encampments near Capitol Campus create additional security concerns for adjacent properties. These factors combine to make <a href="/mobile-vs-fixed-surveillance" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900">flexible, deployable security</a> essential.

            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-3">How much does mobile CCTV rental cost for Olympia properties?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Monthly rental starts at $7,999-$10,000/month depending on the number of cameras, monitoring level, and rental duration. This includes delivery, setup, solar power system, 4K cameras, remote monitoring access, and 24/7 support. Government and multi-unit discounts are available. There are no hidden fees -- delivery, setup, relocation within your property, and pickup are all included. Call <a href="tel:2536832288" class="text-emerald-700 font-semibold">(253) 683-2288</a> for a custom quote.

            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Can security trailers operate during Olympia's rainy season without power hookups?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Absolutely. Our trailers use <a href="/solar-powered-surveillance" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900">solar panels with 72-96 hour battery backup</a>, generating power even on cloudy days at 10-25% capacity. Olympia averages 50 inches of rain annually, and our weatherproof systems are engineered specifically for Pacific Northwest conditions. No external power hookups are required, making them ideal for construction sites, parks, and remote locations throughout Thurston County.
