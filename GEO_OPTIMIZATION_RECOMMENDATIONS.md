# GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) Recommendations for CCTV Trailer

## What is GEO?
GEO optimizes content for AI-powered search experiences like Google SGE, Bing Chat, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other GenAI systems. These systems prioritize structured, authoritative, and comprehensive content.

## Current Status Analysis

### ✅ Strengths
- Good structured data implementation (LocalBusiness, FAQPage, Product, Service schemas)
- Clear service descriptions and pricing
- Location-specific pages for local search
- FAQ page with comprehensive Q&A

### ⚠️ Gaps for AI Comprehension
- Missing review/testimonial structured data
- No HowTo schemas for common tasks
- Limited comparison content for AI to reference
- No video content structured data
- Missing aggregate local business data

## High-Priority GEO Optimizations

### 1. **Enhanced Structured Data Implementation**

#### A. Add Review/Testimonial Schema
```json
{
  "@type": "Review",
  "reviewRating": {
    "@type": "Rating",
    "ratingValue": "5"
  },
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Construction Manager Name"
  },
  "reviewBody": "Saved us $50,000 in theft prevention..."
}
```
**Why:** AI systems heavily weight social proof and real customer experiences.

#### B. Implement HowTo Schema for Common Tasks
Create HowTo pages/sections for:
- "How to Secure a Construction Site"
- "How to Set Up a Security Trailer"
- "How to Calculate Security ROI"

Example structure:
```json
{
  "@type": "HowTo",
  "name": "How to Secure a Construction Site",
  "totalTime": "PT30M",
  "estimatedCost": {
    "@type": "MonetaryAmount",
    "currency": "USD",
    "value": "3500"
  },
  "step": [...]
}
```

#### C. Add VideoObject Schema
For any video content about trailers, setup, or testimonials:

#### C. Implement Q&A Schema Beyond FAQ
Add Question/Answer pairs throughout service pages:

    "text": "Delivery, setup, training, 24/7 support..."
